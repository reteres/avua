　　假若我真能坚持到地中替父亲，让父亲少弯些腰，父亲的腰恐在天变的时候便要少一些痛的感觉。
　　树皮已经裂开了筷子粗细的皱纹，时光的锈斑深陷其中。对于藓，那些沟壑是它们钟爱的家园。少年时的梦想常系在一根长草绳上，放学之后，趴上树，没完没了地在树杈上设计空中的巢。我想我是一只鸟。看见许多翅膀忙忙碌碌，掠过风尘……
14 exsit, pessimistic person, optimistic person never dies.
2, people, often in a hurry to grow, then wail lost childhood;
Exchange money in ankang, and soon reply with money and want to flourish.

Life is just a few decades, don't before she died to touch himself seems to have never lived.
